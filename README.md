# Memory Game Project

## Description
The Memory Game Project is part of Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree to check mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of students. IN the project we had to build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).
But this is not a memory game either! It is a modern game, well designed and full of features!

## How to Play
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

Each turn: (click on the points to knw more about them)

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
